# Mobile Application Project: Wheat (What to Eat) App

[![Wheat App Demo]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw9s1YM_dYk)

At a time when many people have to stay home because of COVID-19, choosing what to eat every day can be a tedious process. Not everyone has the money to order food delivery every day. People have to start cooking. This app that I have developed helps people decide what to cook. 

Features:
(1) Splash screen with animation
(2) Unregistered users can get a random food recipe from Spoonacular API
(3) Facebook login
(4) Registered users can get a food joke from Spoonacular API
(5) Registered users can specify the category of the food recipe

Note:
Spoonacular only allows a certain amount of API requests for a free account. If an API request fails, it might be because the daily limit is reached.
